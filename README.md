# OIBSIP_Python_Task1 😎

## 🎯Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a **basic voice assistant** that can interact with users through voice commands.  
The assistant performs simple tasks such as greeting the user, telling the current time and date, responding with predefined answers, and searching the web for information.

## 🚶🏿‍♂️Steps Performed
1. Installed required Python libraries (`speechrecognition`, `pyttsx3`, `pyaudio`, etc.).
2. Implemented **speech recognition** to capture and process user voice input.
3. Added **text-to-speech functionality** so the assistant can respond back to the user.
4. Programmed core features:
   - Responding to greetings like "Hello".
   - Providing the current time and date.
   - Answering simple, predefined queries.
   - Performing a web search for user requests.
5. Integrated **error handling** to manage unrecognized voice inputs or connectivity issues.
6. Tested the assistant with multiple voice commands to ensure smooth interaction.

## 🖥Tools Used
- **Python** (programming language)  
- **SpeechRecognition** (library for voice input)  
- **pyttsx3** (library for text-to-speech conversion)  
- **PyAudio** (library for microphone input handling)  
- **Datetime** (built-in Python module for time/date)  
- **Webbrowser** (built-in Python module for searching and opening links)  

## 🔑Outcome
- Successfully created a **working voice assistant** that can interact with users using natural voice commands.  
- Users can get greetings, current time/date, and search the web directly through the assistant.  
- The project demonstrates **speech recognition, text-to-speech, and error handling** effectively, making it a beginner-friendly implementation of a voice-based application.
